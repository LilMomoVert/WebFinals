                                <p style="width: 100%; color: white;"><strong>We all know that grocery shopping can be time-consuming, now imagine if you or someone close to you have dietary restrictions in form of a food allergy. Having to read the nutritional label on every single new product you wish to purchase just to make sure it does not contain any trace of something you or your friends are allergic to takes up a lot of time, and some might not be comfortable standing in the store and reading label after label.
                                With further restrictions as reduced eye sight or difficulties reading small texts for instance, makes the task even harder and close to impossible. If you suffer from these restrictions, you are stuck with having to buy products you are already familiar with day after day, thus greatly reducing your opportunities to discover new and exciting dishes that you may not be allergic to.
                                Making sure that you do not ingest something you’re allergic to, especially if you have severe food allergies, is of great importance. If you’re in a rush or stressed out, overseeing some of the ingredients is quite possible and the consequences can be severe.</strong>

                                <p style="width: 100%; color: white;"><strong>Every single product that you can find in any grocery shop has its unique barcode. These barcodes are stored in a database which connect the barcodes, to their designated product. These barcodes enable us to get all the information about which ingredients are within the desired product.
                                The application allows you to specify which ingredients you wish to avoid, simply by checking these off. Then using the camera on your phone, you simply scan the barcode. The application then automatically pulls the product from the database and runs through the ingredients checking if the product contains any of the ingredients or traces of these.
                                </strong>
