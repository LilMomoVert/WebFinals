								<p style="width: 100%;">We all know that grocery shopping can be time-consuming, now imagine if you or someone close to you have dietary restrictions in form of a food allergy. Having to read the nutritional label on every single new product you wish to purchase just to make sure it does not contain any trace of something you or your friends are allergic to takes up a lot of time, and some might not be comfortable standing in the store and reading label after label.
                                With further restrictions as reduced eye sight or difficulties reading small texts for instance, makes the task even harder and close to impossible. If you suffer from these restrictions, you are stuck with having to buy products you are already familiar with day after day, thus greatly reducing your opportunities to discover new and exciting dishes that you may not be allergic to.
                                Making sure that you do not ingest something you’re allergic to, especially if you have severe food allergies, is of great importance. If you’re in a rush or stressed out, overseeing some of the ingredients is quite possible and the consequences can be severe.

                                             Every single product that you can find in any grocery shop has its unique barcode. These barcodes are stored in a database which connect the barcodes, to their designated product. The barcodes enable us to get all the information about which ingredients are within the desired product.
                                            The application allows you to specify which ingredients you wish to avoid, simply by checking these off. Then using the camera on your phone, you simply scan the barcode. The application then automatically pulls the product from the database and runs through the ingredients checking if the product contains any of the ingredients or traces of these. <strong style="margin-left: 5%">Check out the animation for a closer look! -> </strong>

                                        We will not collect any personal information about you through the app; however, if you wish, you can create an Allergy Checker account which will give you numerous benefits. For instance, you will be able to communicate with other users of the app with whom you will be able to exchange tips and tricks about which food products to buy or avoid. You will also be able to see what kind of ingredients other users are allergic to. This is great when you are planning a dinner with someone; it will give you guidance for what kind of dishes you will want to avoid preparing.

                                        Our team of experts is constantly on the lookout for new food products emerging on the market, that contain known allergens. So, whenever a product comes out that contains something you are allergic to, the app will notify you of that, so that you do not accidentally buy a product that is unsafe for you. This goes only for the allergens that you have specified for yourself; if you update your list of allergens, the notifications you receive will always reflect your updated list. Interacting with the app gets much more practical with the ability to integrate it with smartwatches. Whether you have an iOS or an Android smartwatch, Allergy Checker will be able to incorporate itself with it. This way, you will be able to receive the notifications you would normally receive – alerts about new allergens, or a message, if you have an account – without the need to check your phone every time.
