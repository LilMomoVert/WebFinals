</h2>
                                <p style="width: 100%; color: white;"><strong>Exploring new cultures can be both frightening and exciting, it is something new and different from what we’re used to. Our technology is designed to help explore the unknown aspects of different cultures, with the aim to eliminate cultural boundaries and support the integration process of immigrants.</strong><br><br>
                                The desire to integrate differs from one another. But often people tend to avoid engaging in activities that they don’t find entertaining or which don’t result in a direct tangible benefit. Our platform will create the opportunity for everyone despite of skin color, religion or root to get in touch with others with same interest. Based on interests our solution will motivate and encourage people to try out and give themselves a chance to learn other’s culture, religions, food, music and so on. Through these activities, our goal is to increase their linguistic and social skills which in turn benefit the cultural integration.<br><br>
                                The application lets people experience new cultures and reduce the foreign aspects of cultures.  It is easy to judge something based on the information you get from other, and never even bothering to experience it for yourself. We believe that if you could truly experience something for yourself and, see that it might not be as scary or different as you thought we could slowly start reducing the cultural barriers and bring our society closer.

							<h2>Connecting the world.</h2>
							<p style="width: 100%;">Based on the increasing problem with social polarization and integration in bigger cities where immigration rating is high, and the fact that social development in a community is critical for the people to thrive. This consists of many aspect including countless of interactions that occur among social groups, institutions and of course the diversity of individuals. Embossed with these though our engineer team develop this application with the goal and intension to eliminate the boundary between cultures and create a platform which attract people, form bonds and in the same time contribute to the integration process. We believe Culturemates could change the pattern of the social society, and we hope you do too. See you soon!</p>
